# Advent Of Code 2024

This year I am doing the advent of code in Rust

1. Learning about zip, and more about lifetimes
2. Learning about windows, range contains.
3. I decided not to use Regex and ended up regretting it.
4. Recursion for part 1, and created a simple filter for part 2
5. HashMap, HashSet, and "let Some(_) = returns_option() else { ... }"
6. Enum, PartialEq, and Result
7. Recursion - Took longer than I care to admit to figure this one out
8. The point where the antennas also become antinodes was annoying.
9. Rust's VecDeques are awesome. LinkList probably would have worked better in this case.
10.
